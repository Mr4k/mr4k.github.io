Playchess is an attempt to use deep learning to predict good chess moves. As a disclaimer I know that deep learning is far from the best approach to build a strong chess engine. This project was about exploring deep learning. Chess was a good problem because there was lots of free data and the game is complex enough that simpler methods such as svms or logistic regression would not work. This project is still in progress. The current version uses a residual convolutional neural network. You can check it out on [github](https://github.com/Mr4k/playchess).
