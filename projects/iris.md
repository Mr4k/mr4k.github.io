Iris is a puzzle game that I built along with Simon Ever-Hale, Sam Grund, and Jonah Bregstone. It started out as a project from a game design class. We are currently porting it to mobile and html5.

**Gameplay**  
The objective of the game is to reach the exit. Along the way you are blocked by colored blocks. By flipping switches you can change the background color to match the blocks that obstruct you and pass through them.

**Levels**  
I designed a system to procedurally generate puzzles of different difficulties. This allowed us to easily create hundreds of levels.

**Tools**  
To build the prototype we used Unity and C#. The level generation script is in Python.
