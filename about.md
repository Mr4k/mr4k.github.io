Hi, my name is Peter Stefek. I'm a rising senior at Oberlin College majoring in math and computer science. This past summer I interned at <a href = "https://amazon.com">Amazon</a> working on personalization systems. I also enjoy rock climbing. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:pstefek@oberlin.edu">email</a> me or check out my <a href="https://github.com/Mr4k">github</a>.
