Hello!  
My name is Peter Stefek. I am a third year at Oberlin College. I am majoring in math and computer science. Occasionally I have time to do projects outside of school. You can find a selection of these on [github](https://github.com/Mr4k). I especially enjoy computer graphics programming and machine learning. As I hobby I make videogames.
When I'm not programming I can be found biking or rock climbing.
