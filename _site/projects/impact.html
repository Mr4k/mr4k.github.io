<p>The summer of my freshman year I had a simple idea about how to check if two polyhedra would collide in space. I pursed the idea, built the algorithm and dervied all the equations myself from simple mathamatical principles. After I was finished I saw that a similar idea had been used by Id Software however the their math was more complex and required knowlage of special coordinate systems.</p>

<p><strong>Highlights</strong><br />
Impact is simple. There are faster algorithms but they are usually concealed behind 20 page papers of advanced math. Impact is also continuous which means that objects can never step over each other if they are moving too fast.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Idea</strong><br />
The basic idea behind Impact is that if two polyhedra are going to collide then one of the following 3 things must happen:<br />
1) one vertex from one of the polyhedron goes through the face of the other<br />
2) one edge from one of the polyhedron goes through an edge of the other polyhedron<br />
3) one vertex from one of the polyhedron goes through an edge of the other polyhedron<br />
Now all we need to do from here is solve for each of these cases to check if two polyhedra collide. Of course solving those cases takes some thought but I found that they were easier to work with than the other methods I had looked at before.</p>

<p><strong>Demo</strong><br />
You can check out the algorithm in action in <a href="https://mr4k.github.io/Impact/">this</a> demo and view the source on <a href="https://github.com/Mr4k/Impact">github</a>.</p>
