At some point last semester I was challenged by one of my friends to write a program which could beat him in chess over the summer. This may have come after a series of loses to said friend. Now that summer is here I figure that I might as well try to do it. The caveat is that I am terrible at chess. This means that I cannot write a decent position evaulation function by hand. However I am armed with an [archive](http://www.ficsgames.org/download.html) of thousands of chess games and a simple understanding of machine learning techniques. I will try to post regular progress if it occurs.
